# Build your own Copilot (Intelligent App) workshop  

## Workshop Overview  

In this workshop, you will gain a strong understanding of Generative AI basics, Azure Open AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, Semantic Kernel, and how to utilize these concepts to create your own Copilot for your business needs. You will also explore use cases that showcase Copilot product experiences. Using Microsoft's Copilot stack and practical use cases this workshop will guide you in envisioning and creating intelligent systems that integrate foundation models resulting in improved productivity and hyper-personalized product experiences.   

### What to expect?   

Learn Concepts:  

The first segment of the workshop involves a presentation that will provide a solid foundation in Generative AI concepts and guide you through the process of creating your own co-pilot using the Microsoft Copilot stack.  

## Hands-on Lab:  

In the hands-on segment (which will be the bulk of this workshop), participants will get deep exposure to Copilot Stack’s capabilities, especially with Semantic Kernel, Prompt Engineering, and Azure Cognitive Search. During this hands-on lab portion, you'll clone a sample Investment Advisor application and deploy it to Azure. This application harnesses the power of Azure Open AI, RAG, Semantic Kernel, and other Azure services. You will explore the following key features and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms:  

Investment Advisor Copilot: This Copilot, powered by Generative AI, provides investment recommendations based on user preferences. It utilizes Azure Open AI, Semantic Kernel, Azure Cognitive Search (with vector indexing for embeddings), Azure Cosmos DB, Container Apps, and Azure API Management.  

Chat Copilot: Get real-time assistance with investments using this feature. It leverages Azure Open AI, Semantic Kernel, Azure Cognitive Search (with vector indexing for embeddings), Azure Cosmos DB, Container Apps, and Azure API Management.
